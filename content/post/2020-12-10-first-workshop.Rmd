December 10, 2019 was a special day for Maximilian Pfertner’s PhD project EMMA – "Empowering Multimodal and Intermodal Accessibility Analysis": Seven international experts joined us for the first expert workshop within our project funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) - German Research Foundation.  

We presented our analysis of commuters who have changed their workplace location, to find out if this location alone shapes the daily commute (spoiler: it does!). The paper with all the details is currently under review – stay tuned!  

Together with our guests, we came to the conclusion that it is crucial to look at the workplace locations in order enable sustainable mobility in a region. EMMA’s approach to include intermodality in accessibility analysis is important for a better understanding of the real-life accessibility and mobility behavior of workers while opening up new ways to look at the potential impacts of intermodal services.  

Many thanks to our experts Daniel Krajzewicz, Alain L'Hostis, Rolf Moeckel, Klaus Noekel, Marcus Peter, Cecília Silva, and David Vale!  We are looking forward to a second workshop in December!  

EMMA’s next step is the development of an open, intermodal accessibility model for the Munich region, powered by OpenTripPlanner, PostGIS, and RStats – see the picture below for a sneak peek. We are thrilled to share more with the community soon!
