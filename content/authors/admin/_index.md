Maximilian Pfertner joined the Chair in July 2017, after graduating from the international Masterâ€™s Program in Transportation Systems at TUM. He has been working in theory and practice on multimodal mobility concepts as well as on cycling projects, and he believes strongly in the power of integrating various modes with public transport. Since January 2019, he is working full-time on his PhD on intermodal and multimodal workplace accessibility within the DFG-funded EMMA project. He is using open source tools for all his analysis and is building his model with the help of OpenTripPlanner, PostGIS and R.
