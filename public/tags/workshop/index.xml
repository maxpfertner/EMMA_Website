      <description>&lt;p&gt;December 10, 2019 last year was a special day for Maximilian Pfertner’s PhD project EMMA – &amp;ldquo;Empowering Multimodal and Intermodal Accessibility Analysis&amp;rdquo;: Seven international experts joined us for the first expert workshop within our project funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) - German Research Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We presented our analysis of commuters who have changed their workplace location, to find out if this location alone shapes the daily commute (spoiler: it does!). The paper with all the details is currently under review – stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with our guests, we came to the conclusion that it is crucial to look at the workplace locations in order enable sustainable mobility in a region. EMMA’s approach to include intermodality in accessibility analysis is important for a better understanding of the real-life accessibility and mobility behavior of workers while opening up new ways to look at the potential impacts of intermodal services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to our experts Daniel Krajzewicz, Alain L&amp;rsquo;Hostis, Rolf Moeckel, Klaus Noekel, Marcus Peter, Cecília Silva, and David Vale!  We are looking forward to a second workshop in December!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EMMA’s next step is the development of an open, intermodal accessibility model for the Munich region, powered by OpenTripPlanner, PostGIS, and RStats – see the picture below for a sneak peek. We are thrilled to share more with the community soon!&lt;/p&gt;
